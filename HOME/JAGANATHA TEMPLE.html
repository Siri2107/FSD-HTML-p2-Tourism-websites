<p>The Sri Puri Jagannath Temple in Banjara Hills is one of the most well-known temples in Hyderabad. Balaramadev, Lord Sri Krishna’s brother, and Subhadra along with Jagannatha bless the worshippers. The idols, like those at the famous Jagannath temple in Puri, Orissa, are made of wood. The temple hosts Puri-style festivities. Regular puja is open to the public and free of charge. However, to engage in specific rituals and pujas, a fee must be paid in the office here.  Every year, a Ratha Yatra, comparable to the world-famous Puri Jagannath Ratha Yatra, is organized from this temple. The Jagannath Ratha Yatra is a sight to behold.
     Along with Lord Krishna, Balarama, and Subhadra, this temple has upalayas devoted to Hanuman, Shiva, Ganapati, and Goddess Lakshmi.</p>

     <center><img src="jaganatha temple-IMAGE-1.jpg" width="800"></center>
     <p>This temple is a large courtyard in the city center that attracts a large number of pilgrims. This red stone temple is 70 feet tall and is beside the TRS Party Bhavan (Telangana Bhavan). To execute this construction, a large number of artisans from Orissa were brought in. This temple was built by the Kalinga Society, and it was completed in 2009. The Kalinga Cultural Trust currently manages the temple. The temple administration here is excellent.</p>
     <p>The temple is easily accessible and is located in the city center, off the main road. Those arriving in their vehicles will have no trouble finding parking. The temple is conveniently close to the Police Command Center and Telangana Bhavan situated on Road No. 12, a major roadway in the heart of the city.</p>
     <p>Those who are unable to visit the world-renowned Puri Jagannath Swamy Temple can quench their desire by doing pooja at the Jagannath Temple in Hyderabad, which is identical to the Puri temple. It is hardly an exaggeration to suggest that it is a must-see shrine for residents of Hyderabad.</p>
     <center><img src="jaganath temple-IMAGE-2.jpg" width="800"></center>
     <p>Dedicated to the Lord Krishna who is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the main temple houses statues of Lord Jagannath with his brothers - Balabhadra (Balarama) and Subhadra. There are five small temples as well, each dedicated to one God. On the left of the entrance, there is a small temple of Lord Ganesha. In front, there is statue of Lord Shiva. Other small temples house the statues of Goddess Bimala, an incarnation of Goddess Parvati; Goddess Laxmi and Shri Hanuman. On one side, there is shrine of Navgraha as well. There is a dedicated priest for each of the deities.</p>
     <p>Built over an area of 3000 sq. yard, its construction was completed in the year of 2009. To build Puri Jagannath Temple Hyderabad, an approximate of 600 ton of sandstone was brought from Orissa. The temple has been carved intricately; which was done by a close to 60 artisans. While, the inner part of the sanctum sanctorum is made up of plain brick wall which is separated by pillars and three entrance gates which are made up of sandstone. As you enter through the innermost gate, you can see carvings of all the nine incarnations of Lord Vishnu. The idols of main deities are also carved out from wood, which was brought from Orissa, similar to that of Puri temple.</p>
     <p>With a height of 70 feet, the Shikra or the top of the temple is one of its major attractions. This can be seen in most of the Hyderabad’s Jagannath temple photos that you would find online. The temple showcase aesthetically designed interiors. The innermost gate of the temple has carvings of Lord Vishnu’s nine incarnations on it. The exterior of the temple also has carvings of men and women on its walls. These carvings are in some way similar to those of Khajuraho Temples.</p>
     <p>Along with being a popular destination amongst devotees, this temple also attracts art lovers for its captivating architecture.Here the rituals are carried out in the same way as in original Puri Jagannath Temple. Similar way, annual Rath Yatra/ Chariot Festival is also organised in the Hyderabad’s Jagannath temple.</p>
