  <center> <h2>Golconda Fort</h2>
  <img src="golconda-IMAGE-2.jpg"></center>
    <p>Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length.</p>
    <p>It was originally known as Mankal, and built on a hilltop in the year 1143. It was originally a mud fort under the reign of Rajah of Warangal. Later it was fortified between 14th and 17th centuries by the Bahmani Sultans and then the ruling Qutub Shahi dynasty. Golconda was the principal capital of the Qutub Shahi kings. The inner fort contains ruins of palaces, mosques and a hill top pavilion, which rises about 130 meters high and gives a bird’s eye view of other buildings.</p>
    <center><img src="golconda-IMAGE-1.jpg"></center>
    <p>Golconda fort is undoubtedly one of most magnificent fortress complexes in India. The history of Golconda Fort goes back to early 13th century, when it was ruled by the Kakatiya’s followed by Qutub Shahi kings, who ruled the region in 16th and 17th century. 
        The fortress rests on a granite hill 120 meters high while huge crenellated ramparts surround this structure.</p>
        <p>It was initially called Shepherd’s Hill, meaning Golla Konda in Telugu while according to legend, on this rocky hill a shepherd boy had come across an idol and the information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king at that time. The king constructed a mud fort around this holy spot and after 200 years, Bahamani rulers took possession of the place. Later the Qutub Shahi kings converted this into massive granite fort extending 5km in circumference. The fort is considered a mute witness to historic events. 
            The Qutub Shahis reign at Golconda ended in 1687 when it was run over by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who intentionally left it in ruins</p>
        <p>Golconda still boasts of mounted cannons, four drawbridges, eight gateways, and majestic halls, magazines, stables etc. The outermost enclosure is called Fateh Darwaza meaning Victory gate, after Aurangzeb’s army marched successfully through this gate. At Fateh Darwaza one can witness fantastic acoustical effects, which is one among the many famous engineering marvels at Golconda. Clapping your hand at a certain point near the dome entrance reverberates which is heard clearly at the hill top pavilion, almost one kilometer away. This served as a warning note to the inhabitants of the fort of any impending danger, Ofcourse it now amuses visitors. The fort gains an impressive place among the architectural marvels and heritage structures of India and is a testimony to Hyderabad’s glorious past.</p>

            <p>Note : Golconda Fort Timings: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts About Golconda Fort</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Secret tunnels and escape routes.</li>
        <p>It is believed that there is a secret underground tunnel that begins at one of the durbar halls and leads to one of the palaces at the bottom of the hill. The route was originally meant as an escape route for the royals but has never been found since.</p>
        <li>It has inspired 3 places with a similar name</li>
        <p>One in the USA, One in Arizona, one in Illinois, and the other in Nevada
            The mining town of Golconda, in Arizona and now a ghost town, was named after Golconda Fort since it had mines like the ones found near the Golconda Fort in Hyderabad.</p>
            <p>The town was named Sarahsville in Illinois was renamed Golconda on January 24, 1817, after the ancient city of Golkonda</p>
        <li>Ancient madman who saved the city.</li>
        <p>Legend has it that a person called Majzoob who was considered to be a mad man stayed beside the Fateh Darwaza and secured it. At the point when Aurangazab was prepared to overcome the Fort, the presence of this person never permitted them to invade the passage.</p>
        <li>Taali maaro miyan!</li>
        <p>A clap at a fixed place at the entrance can be heard clearly at the ‘Bala Hissar’ pavilion, the highest point almost a kilometer away. This served two purposes – if an intruder got in, it served as a warning. Secondly, it also served as a way for the royals to know they had guests.</p>
        <li>The fort has Mahankali Temple on the top.</li>
        <p>The Sri Jagadamba Maha temple atop Golconda is as famous as the fort itself. The king – Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah was so popular among his subjects that he was called Malkabhiram by Hindus.</p>
        <li> It has inspired movies like Sri Ramadasu, among others.</li>
        <p>The story has it that Rama Das, a revenue official jailed by Abul Hasan Tanah Shah, for misusing state funds to construct Badrachalam Sri Rama Temple, carved images of Rama, Lakshman, and Hanuman on a rock surface in the cell.</p>
        <li>A 400-year-old tree exists</li>
        <p>An African Baobab tree, known to local residents as Haiyan ka Jhad, located in the Naya Qila premises is more than 400 years old. It is said that Arabian traders gifted this to Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah.</p>
