        <p>Situated bang in the heart of the old city of Hyderabad, the Charminar (Urdu ‘Char’ meaning Four and ‘Minar’ meaning Tower) is one of the most recognized monuments in India. 
            It is the architectural icon for the city of Hyderabad, equivalent to the likes of the Taj Mahal of Agra or the Eiffel Tower of Paris and is the most searched historical site of the city on Google. 
            The imposing monument stands regally tall amidst the colorful bangle shops in the labyrinthine Laad Bazar of the old city and presents a beautiful glittering sight after nightfall (7pm-9pm). It is currently maintained by the Archeological Survey of India.
             The Charminar is situated on the eastern banks of Musi River with the Makka Masjid, another famous Qutub Shahi architecture, in the vicinity.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Charminar-IMAGE-3.jpg" width="100%">
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p >This 400-years-old structure was built by Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th Sultan of the illustrious Qutb Shahi dynasty.
             An inseparable part of the history of Hyderabad, the Sultan built the monument right after shifting his capital from Golkonda to Hyderabad. 
             Historians opine that the inadequacy of water and plague forced Quli Qutub Shah to construct a new city. He prayed to the Almighty to end his people’s suffering and pledged to build a mosque at the very site where he prayed. 
             Another legend says that the Sultan saw his beloved, the beautiful Baghmati, at this very site and built the monument as a symbol of his eternal love for her. Though this legend gained popularity, it seems inaccurate when tallied with historical dates. 
             In addition, the couplets inscribed during laying of the foundation stone translate as “Fill this of mine city with people as You have filled the river with fishes O Lord.”, indicating that the construction was concurrent with founding of the city. </p>
             <br>
        <img src="Charminar-IMAGE-4.jpg" width="100%">
        <h2>Structure & Architecture</h2>
             <p >The Charminar was built at the intersection of the historical trade route connecting the markets of Golkonda with the port city of Machhilipatnam. The city of Hyderabad was designed with the Charminar at its center, spread around in four quadrants along the four cardinal directions. Mir Momin Astarabadi of the Qutb Shahi dynasty played an important role and ordered extensive preparations for the design and layout along with that of the new capital city. 
                Architects from Persia were invited to provide additional designs and suggestions. </p>
            <p >Inspired by the shapes of Shiya Tazias built to commemorate the tragic death of Prophet Muhammed’s grandson, Hussain at the battle of Karbala, the structure of the Charminar is perfectly square, with each side measuring 20m. The four grand arches open into four different streets and stand 11m wide. The square structure accommodates four minarets in each corner. The minarets are 56 meters high, house two balconies, and are topped with small delicate domes and intricate carvings on the outside walls. Unlike other prominent Islamic monuments, the minarets are built into the main structure. Inside the minarets there is a spiral staircase with 149 steps and 12 landings. The structure is a fine example of Indo-Islamic architecture with ample Persian influences. While arches and the domes show the influence of Islamic architecture, the minarets reflect Persian influence. 
                    The delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, the balconies and the outside walls speak of Hindu influences.</p>
            <br>


            <img src="Charminar-IMAGE-5.jpg" width="100%">
            <p >Owing to its architectural similarity, Charminar is often called “Arc de Triomphe of the East”. </p>
            <p>The second floor of the structure houses the oldest mosque of the city. It is located on the western side of the roof. The eastern part served as the court at the time of Sultan Qutb Shah. There are two galleries inside the Charminar - one over the other. The main gallery has 45 musallah or prayer spaces opening up to an uncovered space that may accommodate more people during Friday prayers. </p>
            <p>Four clocks were added along the four cardinal directions in 1889. The small Vazu in the middle of the courtyard with a small fountain provides water for Ablution for Muslims offering prayer in the Mosque.</p>
            <p>Legend has it that an underground tunnel connects the Charminar with the Golkonda fort. According to rumors, the tunnel was built to help the kings and queens escape to safety during a siege. These speculations have not been confirmed till date since the existence of any such tunnel has not been reported.</p>

    <p>The Charminar was built by <strong>Sultan Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah.</strong> Charminar was built around 450 years ago, which is today in the heart of Hyderabad city.
         After the construction of the Charminar, the city was built around it. To the north of Charminar, which is the main gate, there are four entrances, which are called <strong>Char Kaman.</strong></p>
         <p>Renowned <strong>Persian</strong> architecture was called for the construction of the city of Hyderabad and the Charminar. It was constructed as a <strong>mosque</strong> and madrasa. Its architectural style was a mixture of <strong>Indo-Islamic</strong>, in which elements of Persian architecture are also seen in some places.</p>

<center><h2>What to See</h2></center>
<p>The main attraction is undoubtedly the view across the Old City to other evocative historic landmarks such as Mecca Masjid. However, the floor of the Charminar that's accessible to tourists also has 45 mushallas (prayer blocks), delicate stucco floral decorations, and ornate balustrades and balconies.</p>
<p>In addition, keep an eye out for the cat's head that's carved into the top of one of the arches on the eastern side of the Charminar.</p>
<p>If you visit the Charminar between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., you'll be able to see it beautifully illuminated.</p>
<img src="charminar-IMAGE-7.jpeg" width="50%">
<center><h2>What Else to Do Nearby</h2></center>
<p>The Old City neighborhood around the Charminar is fascinating to wander through, as it really brings Hyderabad's Islamic legacy to life.</p>
<p>The area around Char Minar is also called the Char Minar, but there are different markets around it. <strong>Lad Bazaar</strong> located near Charminar is known for its jewelry, especially exquisite bangles. <strong>While Pather Gatti Bazaar</strong> is famous for pearls. 
    There will be around 14 thousand shops around the four towers. From Qutub Shahi to the rule of the Nizam and from the British Empire, there are always ongoing activities around Charminar. According to history, this was the only such royal area, where there is so much movement by the common man.</p>
 <p>In the markets around Char Minar, you can buy all types of cheap and expensive items. Along with this, there are also many stalls for eating and drinking here, where Hyderabadi Kulche, Nahari, Biryani are very famous. Hyderabad is one of the cities where a mix of modernism and tradition is seen.</p>
<img src="charminar-IMAGE-10.jpg" width="50%">
<p>Mecca Masjid, built in 1694, is only a few minutes walk south of the Charminar. It's a massive mosque complex with a tranquil pond in the middle of it. Opposite it is 200-year-old Chowmahallah Palace. 
    This imposing official residence of the Nizam rulers has been converted into a museum, with a collection that includes vintage cars and other regal memorabilia.</p>
<p>The landmark Mecca Masjid mosque is one of the most important attractions in Hyderabad. Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the city’s founder, began construction of the mosque in 1617, but it wasn’t completed until 1694 under the rule of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. 
    Virtually all Hyderabad city tours stop here, and a guide can help you navigate the mosque’s rules and customs, which differ for women and/or non-Muslim people.</p>
