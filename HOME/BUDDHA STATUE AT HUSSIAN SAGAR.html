<img src="buddha statue-IMAGE-1.jpg" width="100%">
<font face="time and new roman" size="4">
    <p>The Buddha Statue of Hyderabad is a monolith located in India. It is the world's tallest monolith of Gautama Buddha, erected on Gibraltar Rock in the middle of Hussain Sagar.</p>
<p>The creation of Buddha statue, which has been carved out of single stone, took close to 2 years. About 200 sculptors have worked endlessly to give birth to this marvellous sculpture. It has been carved out of white granite stone which was found on a mountainside, near Nalgonda, located about 40 miles from Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Not many are aware of the fact that the Buddha statue in the Hussain Sagar boasts of being a holy pilgrimage as well. It was sanctified by the spiritual leader Dalai Lama himself in the year of 2006.</p>
<p>This grand Gautam Buddha statue in Hyderabad owes its construction to then CM of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Late N. T. Rama Rao. The idea to create this monolithic statue of Buddha germinated from his visit to New York where he got inspired with the startling beauty of Statue of Liberty. It was after this visit, he showed keen interest to have a symbol which can stand for the opulence of our culture as well as represent the depths of our distinctive heritage.</p>
<p>This statue is a result of the Buddha Purnima Project contribution, which was held in 1985. In the year of 1988, the statue was shipped to Hyderabad. Covering 60 km of distance, it was brought on a gigantic carriage, which had about 192 wheels. There were some troubles initially for mounting the statue. However, in the month of April in 1992, this captivating huge statue of Buddha was raised over the serene waters of Hussain Sagar Lake. Since then, it has been captivating visitors with its incomparable beauty. At the same time, the Lumbini Park with its famous musical fountains was also inaugurated.</p>
<p>To reach the Buddha Statue, you have ferry service from Lumbini Park to the rock of Gibraltar, on which this statue stands. Although a sight worth capturing even from far, it is an enchanting experience to get a close look at the statue. You can also sit at Eat Street and enjoy the view with some mouth watering snacks.</p>
<p>The best time to visit is evening. In evening, the statue is illuminated in different colourful lights. The sight of illuminated statue of Buddha, with just water all around it, is mesmerizing. It is something you cannot miss. The timings are from 8 am to 10.30 pm.</p>
<p>Built in 1562, by Hazrat Hussain Shah Wali, Hussain Sagar Lake is spread over an area of 5.7 square kilometres, across a tributary of the Musi River.</p>

    <p>One of the famous Hyderabad tourist places, Lumbini Park Hyderabad was developed by the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority in the year of 1994. Perfect place for relaxation and amusement, Lumbini Park has been named after birthplace of Siddhartha who later came to be known as Lord Buddha. The park is part of the Buddha Purnima project of Hyderabad Urban Development Authority. After the later Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, this park was renamed at the T. Anjaiah Lumbini Park in the year of 2006. However, popularly it is still known by the name of Lumbini Park.</p>
    <p>At a distance of 3 km from Nampally Railway Station, Lumbini Park is located near the Tank Bund on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake. The Lumbini Park has been named after the birthplace of Buddha and it lies just opposite a famous Buddha statue. The boats to reach Buddha statue start from Lumbini Park.</p>
    <p>The park was developed as part of the Buddha Purnima project of the state government in 1994. It is one of the most beautiful parks in the city of Hyderabad and one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad city. In 2007, it was one of the targets of the 25 August 2007 Hyderabad bombings that killed 44 people.</p>

The key features of the park are the fantastic floral clock, the cascading artificial waterfalls and the dancing musical fountains.
