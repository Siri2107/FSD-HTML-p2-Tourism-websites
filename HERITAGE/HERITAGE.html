<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
    <p>The Heritage Conservation Committee under HUDA was formed by state government in 1981 to retain architectural, historical and social value of buildings.</p>
    <p> Hyderabad Urban Development Authority has listed almost 160 buildings in Hyderabad in Telangana state as heritage structures. Almost 70% of heritage buildings are in private hands. Heritage structures include buildings, monuments, rock structures etc.</p>
    <p>By notifying such structures, Heritage Conservation Committee in collaboration with (INTACH) works to retain their architectural, historical and social importance and tries to convince the owners not to destroy the listed heritage structures lured by the commercial potential of their properties. The buildings are graded as Grade I, Grade II & Grade III.</p>
    <p>However, experts feel due to lack of support from the state government it has become difficult to preserve the status of these buildings.Various buildings such as Ravi Bar, Adil Alam Mansion, Central Building Division & Devdi Ranachand – Ahotichand have been demolished but the names of these buildings are still being retained in the list.</p>
<h1>14 Most Beautiful Heritage Sites in Hyderabad That You Must Visit</h1>

Along with its culture, Hyderabad has also embraced the modern developments in the field of Information Technology. This cosmopolitan city beautifully blends the grand heritage of the past along with modern technology; thus, carving a special place in the hearts of its residents and tourists.</p>

<div style=" width: 60%; float:left;">  
<h1>Alluring Heritage</h1> 
<p>The iconic facades of Hyderabad from the by-gone era weave their story through architectural design that is deeply influenced by the rulers during the period and the purpose of its existence. These ancient monuments are a great architectural marvel that have amazed the visitors for centuries.</p>
<p>If you are planning to visit Hyderabad for a day or two, here are some of the iconic heritage structures that you must visit during your stay in Hyderabad:</p>
<h2>1. Charminar</h2>
<img src="charminar-IMAGE-11.jpg">
<p>Charminar is an Urdu word that translates into four minarets (‘Char’ means four and ‘minar’ means minarets). This iconic structure built in the Indo-Saracenic style serves both as a monument as well as a mosque since the past 400 years. Charminar was constructed in 1591 AD by Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth ruler of Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Charminar is considered to be one of the finest examples of the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture in India. It was built by Quli Qutub Shah after shifting the capital from Golconda to Hyderabad and it had served as a central point for the construction of the city of Hyderabad around it. It is also known as Arc de Triomphe of the East due to its resemblance to the architectural structure.</p>
<p>The square structure of Charminar consists of four arches, one on each side and four minarets, one each corner of the structure. Granite, limestone, mortar and pulverized marble were used in the construction of Charminar. Each of the 48.7 meter high minarets points towards the four cardinal directions. The intricate motifs, balconies and lotus-leaf base motifs are some of the architectural features of the Qutub Shahi dynasty visible on most of their structures. The four clocks were added on each side of the building in 1889.</p>
<p>According to legend, Charminar was built by Quli Qutub Shah to commemorate the eradication of a deadly plague, cholera. It was after the completion of Charminar, that the city of Hyderabad came into existence.</p>

<h2>2. Golconda Fort</h2>
<img src="golconda-IMAGE-7.jpg">
<p>The majestic fort of Golconda is spread over an enormous area of 11 kilometres. The vast expanse of Golconda Fort has marvelled its visitors with its grand architecture. Golconda Fort has evolved to this present structure of a grand fortress after several ruling dynasties of Hyderabad made their contributions towards it. Golconda Fort has mosques, temples, bastions, lawns and royal apartments within its premises. The Light and Sound Show narrates the grand history of this unique fort. I would suggest that every traveller should at least experience the magic of storytelling at the Light and Sound Show to enhance their knowledge about Golconda.</p>
<p>The word ‘Golconda’ is derived from two Telugu words ‘Golla’ and ‘Konda’, which translate to ‘Shepherd’s Hills’. The foundation of the Golconda Fort was laid by the Kakatiya dynasty in the 12th century. Quli Qutub Shah had made another significant contribution to the existing structure of the Golconda Fort by adding eight gates and 87 bastions.</p>
<p>Another attractive architectural feature of Golconda Fort is the Bala Hisar which is the highest point within the premises of the fort. It is said that if anyone claps at the entrance of the fort, the echo of the clap can be heard at Bala Hisar. This acoustical modification at the entrance of the Golconda Fort was used to alarm the royal family, who are almost a kilometre away from the entrance, of any potential intruders.</p>

<h2>3. Mecca Masjid</h2>
<img src="Makkah-Masjid-Hyderabad.jpg">
<p>This splendid mosque located at the south-west of Charminar was built in the seventeenth century. Mecca Masjid is one of the oldest and largest mosques in India. Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah in the year 1614 had laid the foundation of this mosque and the construction was completed during the reign of Aurangzeb in 1694, almost seven decades later. Several Nizams of Hyderabad have been laid to rest in the marble graves in an enclosure of the courtyard of Mecca Masjid.</p>
<p>It is believed that Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah had authorised the use of bricks for construction of the mosque to be prepared from the soil of the Holy Land of Mecca. These bricks were used in the construction of the central arch of the mosque. Therefore, it is called the Mecca Masjid.</p>
<p>The roof of the Mecca Masjid is rested on 15 arches, five on the three sides as the western side has a high wall for Mehrab. The two enormous octagonal columns of Mecca Masjid are carved from a single piece of granite. There are inscriptions of the verses from the Holy Quran on the doors and arches of the Mecca Masjid.</p>

<h1>Culture & Heritage</h1>
<h2>Food</h2>

The city, which was once the capital for Marathis, Kannadigas, Muslims and Telugus as well, represents a unique blend of cuisines, beverages and eating habits. Dum Ka Biryani, Qubani Ka Meetha, Hyderabadi special biryani, Irani Chai, Sakinaalu, Sarva Pindi are among those specialities that others savor in Hyderabad. 
    The hinterlands of Telangana offer a much more cuisine experience with the local flavors and spices going into the making of these dishes. The cuisine of Hyderabad is famous from a small tea stall to grand banquets in five star hotels. Hyderabadi Haleem is not just savored in the region but is also exported by some of the leading brands in the city.
     Made exclusively during the Ramzan season to break the fast held for more than 12 hours, people from all religions vie for this lip smacking non-vegetarian delight. These days, even vegetarian haleem is available widely. Haleem has also earned a GI ( Geographical Indicator) tag. The people of Telangana are known for mixing a variety of spices for making dishes out of jiggery, rice flour,
      wheat flour, maida, chillies, dal and other condiments. Brand Hyderabad towers proudly when it comes to the one-of-its-kind food items.

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Ganga Jamuna Tehzeeb, this is how one can describe a melting pot of cultures called Hyderabad. The predominantly Muslim dominated old city, the new city inhabited by Hindus,

    as it looks today. Teeming with cultural and religious diversity, the city was considered a cosmopolitan hub even during the time of Nizam’s. It is one place where one community blends into another with mutual respect and honor.</p>
<p>nalu, Bathukamma, Vinayaka Chavithi and other festivals are celebrated with fervor side-by-side where the common man enjoys the festivities without any religious discrimination. The entire city lights up not just during Diwali but also Christmas. 
    In short, Hyderabad, located almost towards the Central part of India, on the Deccan plateau represents the culmination of Urdu dialect with Telugu. The language spoken in Hyderabad is different from rest of Telangana, which is infact again categorized into various dialects for every 100-150 km.
     Unity in diversity, Hyderabad is a testimony to this philosophy of brotherhood and peace between various religious and cultural groups. In short, Hyderabad is a beacon of multi-religious, multi ethnic, multi cultural and multi linguistic society at peace with itself. The food, dressing habits, 
     life style and every other aspect varies in the city which has now acquired the tag of a global city in an increasingly globalized world, where it has seamlessly blended with new ideas and people with various nationalities!</p>
